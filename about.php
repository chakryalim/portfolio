        <img class="headshot" src="images/chakrya_lim_headshot3.jpg" alt="Chakrya Lim Headshot">
        <p> My name is Chakrya (pronounced Chalk-re-ya) and I’m a Seattle-based designer with a focus on UX and UI design.</p>
        <p>I create responsive web designs using CSS, HTML, and WordPress and use JavaScript, and PhP to enrich them.  When designing a website or writing content, I’m always creating it for the user, making sure the user will have the best experience and find what they need quickly. </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I’m completing my web design certification at Seattle Central College.  After the completion of the program, I hope to work for charitable organizations that gives back to the world. I am more passionate about my work when I know I’m contributing to a greater good.</p>
        <h2>What Makes Me Unique</h2>
        <p>Before making this career switch, I came from an event planning and administration background so I am very deadline oriented. I can bring my ability to manage deadlines when working on projects so the client’s needs are met on time.</p>
