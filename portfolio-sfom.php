    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Seattle Family of Multiples (SFOM) is an organization that supports families expecting twins, triplets, and more! The main users who visit the website are new parents or parents expecting multiples for the first time. They have a WordPress powered website.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>It was hard for users to find information quickly on the SFOM website. To find information, the user had to use the navigation bar (which was hard to read on small devices) or through links on different pages.  Also their website did not reflect the culture of the club.</p> 
    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>I started off the redesign process by using both top down and bottom up strategies to see if I could structure the site in a more efficient manner. The site had duplicate information on multiple pages</p>
    <h2>Navigation Improvements</h2>
    <p>Working with HTML5 Blank template in WordPress, I used WordPress plugins to make the navigation more responsive and dynamic and easier to read.</p>

    <h2>Efficient Information Placement</h2>
    <p>To solve the problem of finding information quickly,I took the popular topics users would look for and added images with links to the home page so they could be spotted quickly.  Along with that, I added links in the footer so users wouldn’t have to scroll for the nav bar.</p>

    <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
    <p>To resolve the issue of the site not reflecting the club’s culture, I utilized the logo’s color scheme, specifically the blue, and incorporated it into the website.  I decided on the blue because the orange would be too distracting in large quantities and hard to read.  I also gave it a once column layout and added hero images. The layout redesign gives the website an updated and polish look.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Overall the clients thought the website redesigned worked well.  Users can easily navigate to the information they needed.</p>
